## Issues with Previous Course Website

1. Not aesthetic  
   Website looks old-school and does not have a modern design (i.e. font style, font family, general design look old).
   Also, website does not have animation/transition for smoother experience, nor does it have dark mode. 

2. Not responsive  
   Website has a fixed width and is not responsive to different screen size.  
   If you resize the screen, content will overflow and a scrollbar will be shown.

## Improvements in redesigned website

1. More aesthetic  
   We added dark mode (with a toggle control in top-right, default to dark mode) for better night-time experience.  
   We improved the overall design, with a dropdown navigation menu, sticky header and footer, as well as better color scheme and rounded border for better aesthetic experience.  
   In addition, we added animation for each content box for smoother experience.

2. Responsiveness  
   We made the website responsive to different screen size, with automatic width for content boxes, as well as flexbox design to correctly handle left/right sections of the page.

## Challenges

We faced no challenges.

OK, well, there are some slight difficulties on writing pure CSS without framework (i.e. React), so we had to consult the Internet for the usage of certain CSS properties.
